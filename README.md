# STV-ANet
IPI2025_STV-ANet_demo for “Total Variation Regularization based Deep Alternating Neural Network for Blind Unmixing of Hyperspectral Images”

We implemented the STV-ANet using PyTorch 2.2.1+cu118 within the Python 3.8.19 environment. All experiments were performed on a Windows 10 operating system, leveraging the computational power of an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 GPU.
